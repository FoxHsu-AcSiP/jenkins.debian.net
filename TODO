== About jenkins.debian.net

See link:https://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/about.html["about jenkins.debian.net"].

== Fix user submitted bugs

* See link:https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=jenkins;users=qa.debian.org@packages.debian.org[qa.debian.org bugs with usertag 'jenkins'] in the BTS.

== General ToDo

* get rid of FIXMEs in README. Really.
* turn job-cfg/g-i.yaml into .yaml.py
* split etc/schroot/default
* use cucumber+libvirt instead of g-i.sh
* download .isos once in central place
* use schroot for chroot-installation
* build packages using jenkins-debian-glue and not my hacks
* move /srv/jenkins.debian.net-scm-sync.git somewhere public?
* backup /var/lib/jenkins/jobs /var/lib/munin /var/log /root/ /var/lib/jenkins/reproducible.db too /var/lib/jenkins/plugins/*.jpi
* put kgb-client.conf in git and sed passwords from filesystem into it...
* turn udd-versionskew packages names into tracker.d.o links and provide version numbers in output too
* unreproducible-with-buildinfo should really be a state in the DB
* replace amd64 in scripts with $HOSTARCH
* run debbindiff against .changes files in current directory, instead of $LONGPATHES (due to #764459)
* reproducible_scheduler should never fail loudly
* reproducible: dont delete userContent/$pkg on build begin..
* g-i_presentation: use preseeding files on jenkins.d.n and not hands.com

=== jenkins-job-builder related

* use jessie version plus my patches from kali
* change of syntax:
----
properties:
  - priority-sorter:
      priority: 150
----
* this seems to be helpful: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#References (pyyaml which jenkins-job-builder uses supports them)
* cleanup my patches (eg add documentation) and send pull requests on github:
** publisher:logparse
** publisher:htmlpublisher
** svn:scm
** wrappers:live-screenshot

=== livescreenshot plugin

* publish forked livescreenshot plugin and send pull request for my bugfix

== lvc, work in progress, just started ==

* get iso
* preserve screenshots: Took screenshot "/tmp/DebianToaster/apt-2014-12-19T02:33:50+00:00.png"

* to debug cucumber: --verbose --backtrace --expand

* can probably go: dhcp.rb firewall_leaks.rb dhcp.feature firewall_leaks.feature
* more occurances of "the computer boots Tails"

* disabled stuff in common_steps.rb
** twice: #@vm.wait_until_remote_shell_is_up
** #if @vm.execute("service tor status").success?

* "I set sudo password" not really needed for DebianLive7, for now just
** #@screen.wait("TailsGreeterAdminPassword.png", 20)

* $misc_files_dir needed?
* def sort_isos_by_creation_date
  Dir.glob("#{Dir.pwd}/*.iso").sort_by {|f| tails_iso_creation_date(f)}
* search for tails+tor+Tor

* put in update_jdn.sh:
----
    addgroup tcpdump
    dpkg-statoverride --update --add root tcpdump 754 /usr/sbin/tcpdump
    setcap CAP_NET_RAW+eip /usr/sbin/tcpdump
    adduser $USER tcpdump
    adduser $USER libvirt
    adduser $USER libvirt-qemu
----

== Improve existing tests

=== d-i_manual*

* svn:trunk/manual/po triggers the full build, should trigger language specific builds.
* svn:trunk/manual is all thats needed, not whole svn:trunk

=== d-i_build*

* run scripts/digress/ ?
* bubulle wrote: "Another interesting target would be d-i builds *including non uploaded packages* (something like "d-i from git repositories" images). That would in some way require to create a quite specific image, with all udebs (while netboot only has udebs needed before one gets a working network setup).
* build branches? (which?)

=== chroot-installation_*

* inform debian-devel@
* chroot-installation: only trigger (=really run) jobs if available+used packages have changed (save packages in db and compare)
*  warn about transitional packages installed (on non-upgrades only)

----
<pabs> h01ger: how about all of the blends?
<h01ger> pabs, if you could give me concrete (meta-)package names to install, that would be great+very helpful
<h01ger> for ^education* and ^debian-edu* i can find them myself
<pabs> h01ger: hmm, doesn't seem to be easy to find that list, but here are a few: ezgo-* med-* science-* junior-* gis-*
----

* install all the tasks "instead", thats rather easy nowadays as all task packages are called "task*".

=== g-i-installation_*

* pick LANG from predefined list at random - if last build was not successful or unstable fall back to English
** these jobs would not need to do an install, just booting them in rescue mode is probably enough
* for edu mainservers running as servers for workstations etc: "d-i partman-auto/choose_recipe select atomic" to be able to use smaller disk images
** same usecase:  -monitor none -nographic -serial stdio  
** same usecase:  -snapshot maybe???

=== reproducible

* watch: zephyr (debbindiff timeout?)
* watch: cxxtest: dbd failure should be in rbuild output!
* watch: gnuradio debbindiff crashed, yet the build is classified reproducible...
* watch: libsys-gamin-perl hangs while building
* check 0.51-1 is fixed: https://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/rb-pkg/debian-edu-artwork.html
* reschedule those with "debbindiff.py crashed" in rbuild.log and watch them build...

I'm done here. ;-)

* cleanup+rename:
** unschedule_from_db(  	(defined in build.sh...)
** process_packages()	(defined in common.sh...)
** force_package_targets() -> set_linktarget
** STAR?
* merge reproducible_setup_schroot in schroot-create or delete the latter?

* include no js header in the css
* one css, not 2
* graph oldest build age - in days
* mv untested field in stats table too? (as in csv output...)
* list removed packages, eg bobot++ (and remove them after a week automatically)
* generate .json for tracker.d.o

== Further ideas...

=== Test them all

* build packages from all team repos on alioth with jenkins-debian-glue on team request (eg, via a .txt file in a git.repo) for specific branches (which shall also be automated, eg. to be able to only have squeeze+sid branches build, but not all other branches.)

=== Test Debian live

* daily build from sid
* test live images from http://live.debian.net/

== Debian Packaging related

This setup should come as a Debian source package...

* /usr/sbin/jenkins.debian.net-setup needs to be written
* what update-j.d.n.sh does, needs to be put elsewhere...
* debian/copyright is incorrect about some licenses: a.) the profitbricks+debian+jenkins logos b.) the preseeding files
