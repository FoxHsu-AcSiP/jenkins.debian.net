== About jenkins.debian.net

* see link:http://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/about.html["about jenkins.debian.net"]

== General ToDo

* get rid of some reduncacy in job-cfg/*.yaml and also fix the FIXMEs there
* add documentation for jenkins-job-builder and send pull requests on github:
** publisher:logparse
** publisher:htmlpublisher
** svn:scm
** properties: sidebar
* file a bug about jenkins/jenkins-job-builder sometimes "forgetting" about triggers
* mail notifications (to where?)
* proper backup (=daily), see bottom of this document for what to backup
* proper git repo url, outside users/holger
* only trigger (=really run) jobs if available+used packages have changed (save packages in db and compare)

== More tests to be run

=== Tests for supporting d-i development:

* notify debian-boot@l.d.o and #debian-boot about jenkins jobs results
* run scripts/digress/
* bubulle wrote: "Another interesting target would be d-i builds *including non uploaded packages* (something like "d-i from git repositories" images). That would in some way require to create a quite specific image, with all udebs (while netboot only has udebs needed before one gets a working network setup).

=== Test cd-images:

* start client VMs using the profitbricks API: https://www.profitbricks.com/us/media/docs/PB_PublicAPI_EN.pdf (and dhcp)
* to test (at first) weekly images of amd64 std,kde,lxde+xfce weekly and the first sid-di daily
** http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/weekly-builds/amd64/jigdo-cd/
** http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/daily-builds/sid_d-i/20121020-1/amd64/
* use jigdo to download those images

=== Test tasks:

* test installations with (at least) more language tasks enabled

----
<h01ger> how do i install a task outside d-i?
<h01ger> what interesting tasks are there?
<jcristau> tasksel install <task>
<daemonkeeper> h01ger:  http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/tasksel
----

(FIXME: tasksel doesn't work like this)

=== Tests using autopkgtest

* I aware but also lost, after looking at /usr/share/doc/autopkgtest/ - wanna help?
* https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomatedTesting has more information, but help is still welcome to implement this.
* finding packages with autopkgtests: http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2012/11/msg00012.html
** this only lists a few packages, so a very first test could be to compare this list against this: `wget -q http://http.debian.net/debian/dists/unstable/main/Contents-source.gz -O- | zgrep -m1 -E '^debian/tests/control\s'`, make a job out of it and make it UNSTABLE if the diff is non-zero. And as a second step, run those tests...

== To backup

* '/etc/.git'
* '/var/lib/jenkins/config.xml' as well as its plugins
