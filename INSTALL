== About jenkins.debian.net

See link:http://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/about.html["about jenkins.debian.net"].

== Setup

=== Installed software that makes jenkins.debian.net run

* jenkins.debian.net runs Debian wheezy.
* FIXME: describe how jenkins is installed + configured, basically put 'deb http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/debian-stable binary/' into '/etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list' and `apt-get update`
* needed packages are listed in 'update_jdn.sh' and which will also make sure they are installed
** 'update_jdn.sh' is available in the git repo
* package configuration is kept in that git repo and deployed by 'update_jdn.sh' as well.

=== Installing jenkins-job-builder
* rebuild python-jenkinsapi from sid for wheezy:
* `pip install python-jenkins`
* `git clone https://github.com/openstack-ci/jenkins-job-builder ; cd jenkins-job-builder ; python setup.py install`
** actually https://github.com/h01ger/jenkins-job-builder is used atm.

=== Using jenkins-job-builder

* then run `cd /srv/jenkins/job-cfg ; jenkins-jobs update .` to update jobs
* testing: `cd /srv/jenkins/job-cfg ; rm test-output/ -r ; mkdir test-output ; jenkins-jobs test . -o test-output/ ; ls test-output/`
