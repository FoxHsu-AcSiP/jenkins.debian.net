== About jenkins.debian.net

https://jenkins.debian.net is a tool for automated quality monitoring of Debian. It is *work in progress* despite being in existence since October 15th 2012.

Get the source by running `git clone git://git.debian.org/git/qa/jenkins.debian.net.git`. It's all in there, no (relevant) manual setup has been done besides what's in this git repository. (The irrelevant bits are some very simple configuration files containing passwords.)

The (virtualized) hardware is sponsored since 2012 by http://www.profitbricks.com - currently it's using 15 cores and 50 GB memory, thanks a lot!

Some stats are available using link:https://jenkins.debian.net/munin/jenkins-month.html[munin-plugins for jenkins].

If you notice some jobs has problems and you want to find out why, read <<debug,debug certain jobs>> to learn how to do this locally.

== Notifications

There are two types of notifications being used: email and IRC. At the end of each builds console log it says to where notifcations has been send. An adress of the form 'jenkins-foo' means an IRC notification has been send to the #foo IRC channel.

== Jobs being run

There are over 400 jobs being run currently. If you can think of ways to improve the usefulness of certain jobs, please do give feedback!

=== g-i-installation jobs

Installation tests with g-i, the graphical version of d-i, the debian-installer.

* 'g-i-installation_debian_sid_daily-rescue'
** boot of rescue system with daily build sid image

* 'g-i-installation_debian_sid_daily-lxde' and '-xfce' and '-kfreebsd' and '-hurd'
** sid installation of Xfce/LXDE desktop with daily build sid image

* 'g-i-installation_debian_jessie_lxde','-xfce','-kde' and '-gnome' and '-kfreebsd'
** jessie installation of Xfce/LXDE/KDE desktop and kfreebsd install with weekly build jessie image

* 'g-i-installation_debian_wheezy_lxde','-xfce','-kde' and '-gnome' and '-kfreebsd'
** wheezy installation of Xfce/LXDE/KDE desktop and kfreebsd install with wheezy release image

=== debian-installer jobs

* 'd_i_build_$source_package'
** there is one job for each git repo referred to in http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/d-i/trunk/.mrconfig?view=co
** each job pdebuilds the master branch of its git repo on every git push in a sid environment. (If the architecture(s) specified in debian/control are not amd64,all or any the build exits cleanly.)
** while these jobs are triggered on commits, the SCM is only polled every 6min to see if there are new commits.

* 'd_i_manual'
** builds the full installation-guide package with pdebuild in sid on every commit to svn://anonscm.debian.org/svn/d-i/ matching suitable patterns.
** while this job is triggered on commits, the SCM is only polled every 15min to see if there are new commits.

* 'd_i_manual_$language_html'
** builds a language (on wheezy) on every commit of svn/trunk/manual/$LANG with `make languages=$LANG architectures=amd64 formats=html`.
** while these jobs are triggered on commits, the SCM is only polled every 15min to see if there are new commits.
** on successful build, 'd_i_manual_$lang_pdf' is triggered.

* 'd_i_parse_build_logs' - parses logs from http://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/build-logs.html daily, to give them a bit more exposure.
** this job is run daily.

=== chroot-installation jobs

Installation tests inside chroot environments.

* 'chroot-installation_maintainance_$distro':
** make sure chroots have been cleaned up properly
** runs daily at 05:00 UTC and triggers the $distro specific bootstrap job on success
** wheezy is only triggered on the 4th day and 18th of each month (as it was released on the 4th)
** squeeze only on the 25th of each month
* $distro-bootstrap jobs:
** just `debootstrap $distro` (install a base Debian distribution $distro)
** there is one job for *sid*, one for *wheezy* and one for *jessie*: 'chroot-installation_sid_bootstrap', 'chroot-installation_wheezy_bootstrap' and 'chroot-installation_jessie_bootstrap'
* plus there is 'chroot-installation_squeeze_bootstrap_upgrade_to_wheezy', which bootstraps *squeeze* and upgrades that to *wheezy*
** on successful run of the bootstrap job, six $distro-install(+upgrade) jobs are triggered.

* FIXME: describe upgrade jobs here too

* $distro-install jobs (and $distro-install+upgrade jobs):
** `debootstrap $distro`, install a *$set_of_packages* (and upgrade to *$2nd_distro*)
** these $set_of_packages exist: 'gnome', 'kde', 'kde-full', 'lxde', 'xfc', 'full_desktop' (all five desktops plus `vlc evince iceweasel chromium cups build-essential devscripts wine texlive-full asciidoc vim emacs` and (`libreoffice virt-manager mplayer2` (jessie/sid) or `openoffice virtualbox mplayer` (squeeze/wheezy)) and 'develop'
*** install is done with `apt-get install`, except for 'develop' where `apt-get build-dep` is used to install the build dependencies of these packages.

=== Debian Edu related jobs

* All Debian Edu related jobs can be seen at these two URLs:
** https://jenkins.debian.net/view/edu_devel/ about Debian Edu Jessie
** https://jenkins.debian.net/view/edu_stable/ about Debian Edu Wheezy

* Then there are three types of jobs:
** 'g-i-installation_$(distro)_$(profile)':
*** tests installation of a profile with preseeding in the graphical installer,
*** screenshots and logs are preserved and a movie created,
*** testing clients against the main-server is planned too, for some time...
** 'chroot-installation_$(distro)_install_$(education-metapackage)':
*** tests apt installation of a metapackage in a specic distro.
* 'edu-packages_$(distro)_$(src-package)':
** builds one of the six debian-edu packages ('debian-edu', 'debian-edu-config', 'debian-edu-install', 'debian-edu-doc', 'debian-edu-artwork', 'debian-edu-archive-keyring' on every push to it's git master branch
** and whenever 'debian-edu-doc' is build, https://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/debian-edu-doc/ get's updated automatically afterwards too.

=== lintian jobs

* FIXME: describe lintian jobs

=== haskell jobs

* FIXME: describe haskell jobs

=== rebootstrap jobs

* See https://wiki.debian.org/HelmutGrohne/rebootstrap for more information about these jobs.

=== reproducible jobs

* Several jobs are being to test packages whether they can be build reproducible or not. The result is the website http://reproducible.debian.net which is actually just a collection of html files being served from this host.

* There are three builder job, alpha+beta+gamma which are each started every 2min., and there is a scheduler jobs scheduling builds for them. Several other jobs exist to build the html pages.

* The reproducible build jobs use their own pbuilder base.tgz, which has the reproducible apt repo added. And there another sid schroot is being used, where debbindiff (which has lots of depends installed) is run from

* Manual rescheduling of packages is easy, if you have console access. (Hint: you don't but someone on #debian-reproducible will have.) This is how to:

----
jenkins@jenkins:~$ /srv/jenkins/bin/reproducible_schedule_on_demand.sh package1 package2 abcde
----

* blacklisting packages can be done similarily, optionally list reaons in 'notes.git/packages.yml'

----
jenkins@jenkins:~$ /srv/jenkins/bin/reproducible_blacklist.sh package1
----


=== dvswitch jobs

* FIXME: describe dvswitch jobs


=== self jobs

These are jobs for making sure jenkins.debian.net is running smoothly.

[[debug]]
== Debugging certain jobs

*FIXME*: To debug certain jobs, a jenkins setup is actually not needed. Make this easy and describe here.

*This is work in progress too, but mostly just needs documentation!* In principle the shell commands from the various jobs should run on any Debian system just fine. Please use a test system though, as all your data might be eaten.

* Build this source as a debian package and install the jenkins.d.n-debug package and all it's recommends.

=== Feedback

I love to get feedback on this! Please send an email to debian-qa@lists.debian.org or just join #debian-qa on irc.debian.org to report bugs or give other feedback there! 

==== Self signed SSL certificate

Yes, I know, there's a self signed certificate being used. But that's better than plain http anyway and if you provide a better certificate I will very likely happily take it.

=== Setup

See link:https://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/setup.html[INSTALL].

=== ToDo

There is still a lot of work left, check the current link:https://jenkins.debian.net/userContent/todo.html[ToDo list].
