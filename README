== About jenkins.debian.net

http://jenkins.debian.net is pretty much *work in progress*, (hopefully) doing something useful since October 15th 2012.

`git clone git://git.debian.org/git/users/holger/jenkins.debian.net.git`

Virtual hardware sponsored by http://www.profitbricks.com - currently it's just a server (a nice one, with 4 cores and 6 GB memory, thanks a lot!), but in future there will be installation tests on "real" (virtual) hardware and thus more VMs will started on demand as well.

Some stats are available using link:http://jenkins.debian.net/munin/jenkins-month.html[munin-plugins for jenkins].

=== Feedback

I love to get feedback on this! Please join #debian-qa on irc.debian.org to report bugs or give other feedback! Or send an email to debian-qa@lists.debian.org if you prefer mail.

=== debian-installer jobs

* d_i_build_* - there is one job for each git repo referred to in http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/d-i/trunk/.mrconfig?view=co
Each job pdebuilds the master branch of its git repo on every git push in a sid environment. (If the architecture(s) specified in debian/control are not amd64,all or any the build exits cleanly.)
** while these jobs are triggered on commits, the SCM is only polled every 6min to see if there are new commits.
* d_i_manual - builds the full installation-guide package with pdebuild in sid on every commit to svn://svn.debian.org/svn/d-i/ matching these patterns: 
'/trunk/manual/debian/.\*', '/trunk/manual/po/.\*', '/trunk/manual/doc/.\*' and '/trunk/manual/scripts/.\*'
** while this job is triggered on commits, the SCM is only polled every 15min to see if there are new commits.
* d_i_manual_*_html - builds a language (on wheezy) on every commit of svn/trunk/manual/$LANG with "make languages=$LANG architectures=amd64 formats=html". On successful build, d_i_manual_$lang_pdf is triggered.
** while these jobs are triggered on commits, the SCM is only polled every 15min to see if there are new commits.
* d_i_parse_build_logs - parses logs from http://d-i.debian.org/daily-images/build-logs.html daily, to give them a bit more exposure.
** this job is run daily.

=== webcheck jobs

* three jobs for running webcheck against www.debian.org, www.debian.org/News and www.debian.org/security
* several webcheck jobs for running again various debconf.org websites

These jobs are only run on the first day of each month.
